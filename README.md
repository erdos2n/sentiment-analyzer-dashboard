# Sentiment Analyzer

I built this app out of the blue. I really wanted to practice some dash applications and I thought this was a great way to do it. 

This project combines
* creating a dash app with app callbacks
* creating a dash app that uses the jumbotron and card components
* implements Natural Language Processing by way of sentiment analysis
* using some minor custom css
